tkmedit DOC1009 orig/anat.mgz -overlay /Volumes/Zeus/DOC/DOC1009/DOTS_func/HighLevel.gfeat/cope3.feat/stats/zstat1.nii.gz -fthresh 3 -fmid 10 -fmax 15

### instructions for using tkmedit:

0. move your cursor over the voxels above threshold you want
1. select contiguous voxels by threshold (under tools -- see 1.png)
2. you save it as a label (2.png)
3. you clear your select voxels and pick another region (3.png)

++++++++++++++ IGNORE +++++++++++++++++++

for example tkmedit calls i've attached a bash script i threw together last time i was doing this (view.sh).

you've saved freesurfer "label" files.  to make them into a binary mask in volume space you use mri_label2vol (see attached script label2Mask.sh for example calls).

also, i move my sig.nii.gz volumes for a given contrast into anatomical space with mri_vol2vol before starting this whole thing, but i don't think you have to do that -- you would just supply tkmedit with a registration file.

concert ROI to nifty and save in subject's folder:

mri_label2vol --label /usr/local/freesurfer/subjects/ea1/label/rFFA.label --temp /usr/local/freesurfer/subjects/ea1/mri/orig/anat.mgz --identity --o ~/Desktop/dynStat_scene/ea1/ROI/rFFA.nii.gz
